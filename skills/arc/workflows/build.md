# Build Workflow

Quick build for small-to-medium scope work. No formal plan, but still uses TDD and verification disciplines.

## Process

### Step 1: Assess Scope

Read the request. Consider:
- How many files will this touch?
- How many distinct components/features?
- Are there complex interactions?
- Is there significant new architecture?

**If scope is large** (>5 files, multiple features, new patterns):
```
"This looks substantial. It would benefit from proper design and planning.
Want me to run /ideate instead?"
```
Wait for response. If yes, invoke ideate workflow.

**If scope is small/medium:** Proceed.

### Step 2: Quick Mental Model

Briefly outline (don't write a doc):
- What needs to change
- What order to do it
- What to test

Share with user: "Here's my approach: [2-3 bullets]. Sound right?"

### Step 3: Build with TDD

Follow `disciplines/test-driven-development.md`:

For each piece:
1. Write failing test
2. Verify it fails
3. Write minimal code to pass
4. Verify it passes
5. Refactor if needed

### Step 4: Continuous Quality

After each implementation:
```bash
pnpm tsc --noEmit    # TypeScript check
pnpm biome check .   # Lint
```

Fix issues immediately.

### Step 5: Verify Before Done

Follow `disciplines/verification-before-completion.md`:
- Run full test suite
- Check all tests pass
- Confirm no TypeScript errors
- Confirm no lint errors

Only then claim completion.

### Step 6: Offer Next Steps

"Build complete. Would you like to:"
1. Run /test to verify coverage
2. Run /document to capture what we built
3. Add follow-up items to /tasklist
4. Done for now

## What Build is NOT

- Not for large features (use /ideate)
- Not for exploratory work (use /ideate)
- Not for things needing design review
- Not a shortcut to skip quality
