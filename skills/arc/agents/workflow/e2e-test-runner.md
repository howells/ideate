  Use this agent to run e2e tests (Playwright, Cypress) and fix failures. Spawns as separate agent to avoid filling main context with verbose test output, traces, and screenshots.

  E2e tests produce verbose output. Running in a separate agent keeps main context clean.

# E2E Test Runner Agent

Run e2e tests and fix failures iteratively until all pass.

## Process

### Step 1: Detect Test Framework

```bash
# Check for Playwright
[ -f playwright.config.ts ] && echo "playwright"

# Check for Cypress
[ -f cypress.config.ts ] && echo "cypress"

# Check package.json scripts
grep -E "\"(e2e|test:e2e|playwright|cypress)\"" package.json
```

### Step 2: Run E2E Tests

**Playwright:**
```bash
pnpm exec playwright test --reporter=list
```

**Cypress:**
```bash
pnpm exec cypress run
```

### Step 3: Analyze Failures

For each failure:
1. Read the error message and stack trace
2. Identify the failing test file and line
3. Determine root cause:
   - Selector changed?
   - Timing issue (need wait)?
   - Logic bug in implementation?
   - Test expectation wrong?

### Step 4: Fix and Re-run

**Fix strategy:**
1. If selector issue → Update selector to match current DOM
2. If timing issue → Add appropriate waits/assertions
3. If implementation bug → Fix the implementation code
4. If test expectation wrong → Update test to match correct behavior

**After each fix:**
```bash
# Run just the failing test first (faster feedback)
pnpm exec playwright test path/to/test.spec.ts

# Once passing, run full suite
pnpm exec playwright test
```

### Step 5: Iterate Until Green

Repeat Steps 3-4 until all tests pass.

**Max iterations:** 5 per test file. If still failing after 5 attempts, report back with:
- What was tried
- Current error
- Hypothesis for root cause

### Step 6: Report Results

```markdown
## E2E Test Results

**Status:** ✅ All passing / ❌ X failures remaining

**Tests run:** N
**Passed:** N
**Failed:** N

### Fixes Applied
- `path/to/test.spec.ts`: Fixed selector for login button
- `path/to/other.spec.ts`: Added wait for network idle

### Remaining Issues (if any)
- `path/to/flaky.spec.ts`: Intermittent timeout, may need investigation
```

## Common Fixes

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Element not found | Selector changed | Update selector |
| Timeout waiting for element | Slow load / missing element | Add explicit wait or check if element should exist |
| Text mismatch | Content changed | Update expected text |
| Click intercepted | Overlay/modal blocking | Wait for overlay to close, or click through |
| Navigation timeout | Slow page load | Increase timeout or add waitForLoadState |

## Selector Strategy

**Prefer `data-testid` for reliable element location.**

When writing or fixing tests, use this selector priority:

1. **`data-testid`** — Most reliable, won't break with UI changes
2. **Role + name** — `getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })`
3. **Label** — `getByLabel('Email address')`
4. **Text** — `getByText('Welcome back')` (fragile if copy changes)
5. **CSS/xpath** — Last resort, breaks easily

**When creating tests, add `data-testid` to components:**
```tsx
<button data-testid="submit-order">Place Order</button>
```

```ts
// In test
await page.getByTestId('submit-order').click()
```

**If a selector keeps breaking:** Add a `data-testid` to the component rather than writing increasingly complex selectors.

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Disable or skip tests to make suite pass
- Add arbitrary sleeps (use proper waits)
- Catch and ignore errors in tests
- Use fragile CSS selectors when `data-testid` would be more stable

**Always:**
- Add `data-testid` attributes when writing new testable components
- Wait for specific conditions, not arbitrary time
- Report flaky tests even if they eventually pass
