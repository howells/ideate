<objective>
Capture solved problems as searchable documentation immediately after confirmation. Builds institutional knowledge that informs future design sessions.
</objective>

<triggers>
**Auto-invoke after phrases:**
- "that worked"
- "it's fixed"
- "working now"
- "problem solved"
- "that did it"

**Manual:** `/compound` command

**Only for non-trivial problems:**
- Multiple investigation attempts needed
- Tricky debugging that took time
- Non-obvious solution
- Future sessions would benefit

**Skip for:** Typos, obvious syntax errors, trivial fixes.
</triggers>

## Step 1: Gather Context

Extract from conversation history:

**Required:**
- **Symptom**: Observable error/behavior (exact error messages)
- **Investigation**: What didn't work and why
- **Root cause**: Technical explanation
- **Solution**: What fixed it (code/config changes)
- **Prevention**: How to avoid in future

**If critical context missing, ask:**
```
I need a few details to document this:

1. What was the exact error message or symptom?
2. What did you try that didn't work?
3. What was the root cause?
```

## Step 2: Classify Problem

Determine problem type (maps to folder):

| Type | Folder | Examples |
|------|--------|----------|
| `build-error` | `docs/solutions/build-errors/` | TypeScript errors, bundler issues |
| `test-failure` | `docs/solutions/test-failures/` | Flaky tests, mocking issues |
| `runtime-error` | `docs/solutions/runtime-errors/` | Crashes, exceptions |
| `performance` | `docs/solutions/performance/` | Slow queries, memory leaks |
| `ui-bug` | `docs/solutions/ui-bugs/` | Layout issues, state bugs |
| `integration` | `docs/solutions/integrations/` | API issues, auth problems |
| `config` | `docs/solutions/config/` | Environment, tooling setup |

## Step 3: Generate Filename

Format: `[problem-summary]-[YYYYMMDD].md`

Examples:
- `drizzle-migration-not-running-20260114.md`
- `clerk-session-not-persisting-20260114.md`
- `tailwind-classes-not-applying-20260114.md`

## Step 4: Create Documentation

```bash
mkdir -p docs/solutions/[category]
```

Use `templates/solution-template.md` structure:

```markdown
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
problem_type: [build-error|test-failure|runtime-error|performance|ui-bug|integration|config]
severity: [critical|high|medium|low]
tags: [keyword1, keyword2]
stack: [next, drizzle, clerk, etc.]

# [Clear Problem Title]

## Problem
[1-2 sentence description]

## Symptoms
- [What you saw]
- [Error messages]

## What Didn't Work
**Attempt 1:** [Description]
- Why it failed: [Reason]

## Solution
[The fix that worked]

```typescript
// Before (broken):
...

// After (fixed):
...
```

## Why This Works
[Root cause explanation]

## Prevention
- [How to avoid this]
- [What to watch for]

## Related
- [Links to similar issues if any]
```

## Step 5: Present Options

```
✓ Solution documented

File: docs/solutions/[category]/[filename].md

What's next?
1. Continue working (default)
2. View documentation
3. Link to related issue
4. Other
```

**The Knowledge Loop:**

```
ideate (design) → implement → encounter problem → solve → /compound (document)
                                                              ↓
                                         informs future ideate sessions
```

When starting new ideate sessions, episodic-memory search includes `docs/solutions/` to surface past learnings.
